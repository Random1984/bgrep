Binary grep.

It's a very simple utility for searching for the binary strings in all files, recursively.

Usage bgrep.py hex_string
Where hex_string is like "001122aabb"

That will result something like:

[file.exe] pattern found

If you wish to suppress file access errors, run it like:

bgrep.py hex_string 2>nul
